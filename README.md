# Michael Ferguson's Church Documents

I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints][1]
(LDS), sometimes referred to as [Mormons][2]. The LDS church relies on
a lay ministry; clergy are not paid, and regular members of the church are
asked to serve in various positions, such as a Bishop, a sunday school
teacher, or a leader in the local chapter of the [Boy Scouts of
America][3]. This repository contains my notes, lessons, and other stuff
that I've accumulated over the years as I've served in the church.
